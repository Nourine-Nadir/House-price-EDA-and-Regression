Regression Analysis and EDA for House Price Prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing a regression analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for predicting house prices. The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Loading house price data from a CSV file.
Cleaning and organizing the data using Pandas.
Feature Engineering and Imputation:

Handling missing values and imputing using the mean strategy.
Feature engineering, such as polynomial transformation for feature expansion.
Data Visualization:

Exploratory data analysis using histograms and bar plots for selected columns.
Scatter plots with custom legends to visualize relationships between different distances.
Data Scaling and Standardization:

Scaling features using StandardScaler.
Correlation Analysis:

Computing and visualizing the correlation matrix.
Regression Modeling:

Implementing Ridge Regression with cross-validated alpha selection.
Evaluating model performance using mean absolute error (MAE).
Model Serialization:

Saving the best-performing Ridge Regression model, including alpha, weights, bias, and MAE, using Pickle.
